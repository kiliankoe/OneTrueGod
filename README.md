## What is this?

A bit back there was a quite a stir when people noticed that several npm packages were doing malicious things on developer's machines when being `npm install`'d, which runs arbitrary code. This is a tiny proof of concept of the same idea, but through dependency managers known to us Cocoa devs. Of course this does nothing malicious, it just helps you out by setting your wallpaper to the only valid option ðŸ‘Œ
